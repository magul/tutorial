Django is written in Python. We need Python to do anything in Django. Let's start by installing it! We want you to install Python 3.6, so if you have any earlier version, you will need to upgrade it.

First check whether your computer is running a 32-bit version or a 64-bit version of Windows, by pressing the Windows key + Pause/Break key which will open your System info, and look at the "System type" line. You can download Python for Windows from the website https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/. Click on the "Latest Python 3 Release - Python x.x.x" link. If your computer is running a **64-bit** version of Windows, download the **Windows x86-64 executable installer**. Otherwise, download the **Windows x86 executable installer**. After downloading the installer, you should run it (double-click on it) and follow the instructions there.

One thing to watch out for: During the installation, you will notice a window marked "Setup". Make sure you tick the "Add Python 3.6 to PATH" checkbox and click on "Install Now", as shown here:

In upcoming steps, you'll be using the Windows Command Line (which we'll also tell you about). For now, if you need to type in some commands, go to Start menu → Windows System → Command Prompt. You can also hold in the Windows key and press the "R"-key until the "Run" window pops up. To open the Command Line, type "cmd" and press enter in the "Run" window. (On newer versions of Windows, you might have to search for "Command Prompt" since it's sometimes hidden.)

Note: if you are using an older version of Windows (7, Vista, or any older version) and the Python 3.6.x installer fails with an error, you can try either:

1. install all Windows Updates and try to install Python 3.6 again; or
2. install an [older version of Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/), e.g., [3.4.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-346/).

If you install an older version of Python, the installation screen may look a bit different than shown above. Make sure you scroll down to see "Add python.exe to Path", then click the button on the left and pick "Will be installed on local hard drive":
